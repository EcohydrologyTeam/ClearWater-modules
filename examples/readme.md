This folder is for Jupyter notebooks to teach users how to use the package. If designed as a tutorial, notebooks might be numbered in the sequence they should be used.

`data` is for data files required to run the example notebooks.
`dev_sandbox` is for exploratory work by the development team as they develop new capabilities, including for informal testing.
`temp` is for temporary output files that users might create during the demo. This subdirectory will be in the .gitignore, so that output files are not saved to the repo.
